# Class Countdown Remade
This is essentially a website that has a timer counting down to the end of each period. It is easily editable for whatever times your period ends - all you have to do is replace the list of times in the script.js file.
Edited to specify changed times on Monday, Wednesday and weekends. 
I also added seconds and milliseconds for fun. Expect a toggle to enable/disable it soon
